# taclink_sensing
Inference program for vision-based large-scale tactile sensing (TacLink). The sensing rate (processing speed) can reach up to 100Hz without 3D visualization. It would be recommended to run on a Ubuntu-based PC for the maximum processing speed. 

## Dependency
The program was run successfully on Python 3.8 with the following dependencies:
- requirements.txt
- pytorch
  
## Getting Started
Clone the repository, download the trained model file (.pt), and put it into the `network` directory.
